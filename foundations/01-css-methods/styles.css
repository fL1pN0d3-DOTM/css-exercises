/* Full Disclosure: the actual CSS syntax for these lessons 
was all AI-generated by ChatGPT. I get there might be some
ethical concerns around using AI and the idea that we should 
be writing/scripting the code ourselvs, but I am of the 
opinion that it is more efficient to just generate the CSS 
and manually tweak it, as it saves time, with the end result 
being the same. I could just as easily write this, and having
been using CSS for almost 2 decades, I don't feel it's 
necessary for my growth as an engineer to write all this 
from scratch. */
